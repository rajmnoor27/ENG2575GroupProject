        <p>
            Video games originated in the 1950s and 1960s 
            with simple creations like Tennis for Two and Spacewar! and gained widespread 
            recognition with the release of Pong in 1972. The 1980s saw the rise of home consoles,
            such as the Atari 2600 and NES, which brought gaming into households worldwide. 
            By the 1990s, technological advancements enabled the development of more complex games, 
            while the internet introduced the possibility of global connections through online gaming. 
            Today, video games are accessible on a wide range of platforms, including portable devices 
            that allow gaming on the go.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <img class="ps5" src="img/vg.jpg">
        <p>Video games have the potential to enhance valuable skills but can also lead to focus issues, 
            emotional challenges, and aggression when overindulged. Maintaining balanced habits, such as 
            incorporating physical activity and social interaction, can help mitigate these negative effects. 
            Encouraging moderation allows children to enjoy the benefits of gaming while minimizing its risks. 
            With proper guidance and limits, gaming can become a positive influence on child development.</p>
